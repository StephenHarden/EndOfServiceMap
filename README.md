# EndOfServiceMap

This is my visualisation of Enterprise Products that are or have gone end of service/life.

This document can be used by IT departments to plan End-of-Service management activities.

You will find PDF, PNG and PPTX versions of each document.

See Change Log for update details.

Last updated: Sept, 2020.


To be clear, whilst I am a Microsoft employee, these are not official Microsoft published diagrams. They are a visual representation of the end of life roadmaps gathered from https://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle.

I have carefully balanced the level of detail to ensure all the notable enterprise products are accounted for, but it is certainly the case that not all products are present in these diagrams. So my offer to you is that if you see something missing and believe it should be included please reach out and I will do my best to build it in to a subsequent release.

Please contact me on LinkedIn if you'd like to discuss, provide feedback, or request changes / updates.

All feedback is greatly appreciated!

Regards,
Steve
